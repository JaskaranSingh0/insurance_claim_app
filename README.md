A new Flutter project.

## 🚀 Live Demo

The app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages: [https://jaskaransingh0.github.io/insurance_claim_app/](https://jaskaransingh0.github.io/insurance_claim_app/)

## 📦 Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages:

- **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to the `main` branch triggers a new deployment
- **Manual Deployment**: You can also trigger deployment manually from the Actions tab
- **Deployment Process**:
  1. GitHub Actions workflow builds the Flutter web app
  2. The build output is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch
  3. GitHub Pages serves the app from the `gh-pages` branch
- **Workflow File**: See [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) for configuration details
